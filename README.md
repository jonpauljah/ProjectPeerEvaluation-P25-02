# PEERS: Peer End to End Review System

Peer Evaluation Automation and Feedback System

Date: 09/04/2025  
Status: Planning / In Progress

A web-based platform to streamline peer evaluations in team-based courses. Professors can securely create and manage student rosters, assign students to courses/teams, trigger email invitations, and receive structured, professor-friendly reports with both numeric and textual feedback. Optional AI features may summarize comments and flag potential concerns, depending on timeline and scope.

## Objectives

- Simplify and automate peer evaluations for team-based courses
- Provide an intuitive UI for professors and students
- Ensure secure roster management and personalized evaluation links
- Generate clear, actionable reports (numeric + textual)
- Optionally use AI to summarize feedback and detect red flags (time-permitting)

---

## Core Features

- Secure professor login and multi-course management
- Student roster upload and team assignment
- Personalized email invitations for peer evaluations
- Personalized evaluation forms per student/team
- Aggregated, structured reporting for professors
- Downloadable reports (raw data, calculated scores, summaries)
- Optional AI assistance:
  - Text summarization of comments
  - Red flag detection (e.g., significant discrepancies or concerning language)

AI features are optional and will depend on remaining timeline after core milestones are met.

## Getting Started (For New Users)

### Prerequisites

1. **Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)**
  - Download and install the LTS version for your operating system.
  - npm is included with Node.js.

2. **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)** (optional, for cloning the repo)
  - Or download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

3. **Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** (already installed)

---

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
  - Using Git: `git clone <repo-url>`
  - Or download ZIP and extract.

2. **Open the Project Folder in VS Code**

3. **Install Dependencies**
  - Open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`)
  - Run:
    ```bash
    npm run setup
    ```
  - This will install all required packages for both frontend and backend.

4. **Start the Application**
  - To start both frontend and backend together:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  - Or use the provided scripts:
    - Windows Batch: `./start.bat`
    - PowerShell: `./start.ps1`

5. **Access the App in Your Browser**
  - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

### Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing dependencies, re-run `npm run setup`.
- If ports 3000 or 5000 are in use, close other apps or change the port in the config.
- For Windows, you may need to allow scripts to run (see PowerShell execution policy).
- If you have issues with email sending, check your `.env` file for SMTP settings.

---

### Available Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend servers simultaneously
- `npm run setup` - Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
- `npm run start:backend` - Start only the backend server
- `npm run start:frontend` - Start only the frontend server (default React scripts)

---

Individual generated files under `build/` and utility scripts under `src/backend/scripts/` are condensed above. Local checkouts also contain `.git/` metadata and may contain `.agents/` and `.codex/` configuration directories; these are not tracked project files.

The frontend uses the root `package.json`; there is no `src/frontend/package.json`. Run frontend and shared development commands from the repository root. The active frontend entry point is `src/index.js`, which imports `src/frontend/App.js`; `src/frontend/index.js` is an additional entry file and is not the entry point used by the current build.

## Tech Stack

To be finalized by Milestone 1 (09/28/2025).  
Documentation will specify:
- Front-end framework (TBD)
- Back-end framework (TBD)
- Database (TBD)
- Email service provider / SMTP (TBD)
- Authentication (TBD)
- Optional AI/NLP services or libraries (TBD)
- Deployment target (TBD)

---

## High-Level Workflow

1. Professor creates course and uploads roster (with emails) and team assignments.  
2. System generates personalized evaluation links.  
3. Email service sends invitations/reminders to students.  
4. Students evaluate teammates via web forms.  
5. System aggregates responses and computes scores.  
6. Professor downloads or views reports (numeric + textual).  
7. Optional: AI summaries and flagged red flags for review.

---

## Lower-Level Tasks 

- Professor logs into the system and creates a new course. 
   - Professor can update course information 
   - Professor can delete course information 
- Professor uploads student roster csv files that include students' names and emails.  
   - Professor can add students to courses manually 
   - Professor can edit student information 
   - Professor can delete student information
- Professor creates teams
   - Professor can add students to teams
   - Professor can delete students from teams
   - Professor can edit teams’ information
   - Professor can delete teams’ information
- Professor selects course and sends evaluation rubric 
- Evaluation Link Generation 
  - System automatically generates unique, secure evaluation links for each student. 
  - Links are personalized based on team membership. 
- Email Distribution 
  - Integrated email service sends:  
  - Initial invitations with evaluation links. 
  - Automated reminders to non-respondents. 
  - Emails are personalized and tracked for delivery status. 
-  Peer Evaluation Submission 
  - Students access web-based forms via their unique links. 
  - Forms include structured questions for teammate evaluation based on the rubric. 
  - Submissions are encrypted and stored securely. 
- Feedback Aggregation and Scoring 
  - System aggregates and evaluates feedback. 
  - System calculates grades using preset formulas. 
- Optional AI Analysis 
  - AI module generates:  
  - Summarized feedback per student/team. 
  - Alerts for potential red flags (e.g., low scores, concerning comments). 
- Report Access for Professors 
  - Professor can:  
  - View reports online or download them. 
  - Choose between raw data, calculated scores, and AI summaries. 
  - Filter by team, student, or evaluation round. 
  - AI module tested and optional for use 

## Security & Privacy

- Store student data securely; restrict access to authorized users only.  
- Use HTTPS for all traffic; protect credentials and tokens.  
- Avoid sending sensitive data in plain text emails.  
- Comply with institutional policies and applicable regulations (e.g., FERPA).  
- Document data retention and deletion policies.

---

## Risks, Assumptions, and Planning

- No major delays currently foreseen.  
- Capacity planned with two front-end and two back-end developers to cover downtime.  
- Client (professor) availability expected to be consistent.  
- AI features are optional and contingent on time after core functionality is complete.  
- Email deliverability and spam filtering may require configuration and testing.

---

## Contributing

- Use feature branches and open pull requests for review.  
- Link issues to PRs and keep commit messages descriptive.  
- Follow coding standards defined in CONTRIBUTING.md (to be added).  
- Document changes in PR descriptions and update relevant docs.
